## Reproducing the Environment

To replicate the environment used for model training and analysis, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Conda:
   Ensure you have Conda installed. If not, download it from [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

### 2. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
   ```
### 3. Create the environment from the .yaml file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f Conda_Environment/environment.yaml
   ```
### 4. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate base
   ```
### 5. Check if the environment is present:
   ```bash
   conda list
   ```
